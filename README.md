# udacity-animal-trading-cards
The third project in [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program called "Animal Trading Cards".

## Description
Given a zip-file containing a HTML-file, a CSS-file, a placeholder image and a design prototype.Replace the information and image with your favorite animal's information and image. Style it using [valid CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) in accordance with the design prototype. 

## Prerequisites
The course was 4.5 hours and contained CSS Syntax, a related problem set and a short course on how to write code faster using coding editors like [Atom](https://atom.io/), utilizing shortcuts and plugins. Below is a short summary of the content; just be adviced that this in no way is a comprehensive or detailed explanation of the content covered.

### CSS Syntax

After a short introduction to what [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) is the CSS ruleset was explained. It then described the importance of using [comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)) and how to use them in CSS. Thereafter tag [selectors and attributes](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) were introduced. It then explained how to use [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) both to debug and insert CSS styles into web sites.

It continued with explaining [CSS units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) and different ways to introduce [colors on web sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Shorthand_hexadecimal_form), using [hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) and rgb values, how to [convert](http://hex.colorrrs.com/) them as well as [named colors](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/named-colors-and-hex-equivalents/). Finally it explained how to use [shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties).

## Solution
Used the appropriate CSS rules to style the document in accordance with the design mockup and validated it in W3C Validator. You can view it [here](https://gjarnling.github.io/udacity-animal-trading-cards/).

## Closure
The solution met the specifications.
