# udacity-animal-trading-cards
The third project in [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program called "Animal Trading Cards".

## Description
We were given a zip-file containing a HTML-file, a CSS-file, a placeholder image and a design prototype. We were then told to replace the information and image with our favorite animal's information and image. This was then styled using the valid CSS in accordance with the design prototype. 

## Prerequisites
The lessons given before the project were 4.5 hours CSS Syntax and a related problem set. Apart from teaching the basics of CSS it gave the student several references for where to find more information regarding what CSS properties etc. to use, for instance [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).

The course also included a 1 hour course on how to write code faster using the editor of your choice. It focused on [Atom](https://atom.io/) which is the coding editor I use.
